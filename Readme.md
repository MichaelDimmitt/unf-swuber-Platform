## Why Swuber?
It started in parking lot 14; on the way to class I asked a friend if they could give me a ride. the friend was not leaving but also going to class. As a result we walked together and not alone. Later when leaving the library I was forced to walk alone by lack of communication and lack of traffic at that hour.  

I did not want to walk to my car. I waited outside the library for someone I knew. Eventually I gave up but the idea was born. Generosity(reputation) and the capital of my parking spot could be used to get me to my car without having to walk alone. 

For years people have tried to solve the problem of finding a parking spot at the University of North Florida.
